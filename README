This is the code for a Chrome extension that helps you preview
how fonts from the Google Fonts API look on existing webpages.

There is currently no API to query the fonts directory for metadata
on the fonts, so this extension is manually updated based on the Google
site every few weeks.

The manual update process is:
- Download CSS files from http://code.google.com/webfonts, save to fonts.css
- Replace '::Menu' in fonts.css with ''
- Copy JSON from http://code.google.com/webfonts/preview, save to fonts.js

Here are some features that I would like to add in the future:
- Automate the update process somehow
- Filter font list by serif/sans serif/etc, like on Web Fonts directory
- Sort font list (like on Web Fonts directory)
- Ability to specify a CSS selector to apply font changes to (using querySelectorAll)

If you make improvements to this (like the suggestions above),
please let me know.
